A World of Warcraft Classic Era addon that emulates the classic "consider" command from early MMORPGs. Get instant feedback on how challenging a target will be before engaging in combat. Works best without nameplates, player and targets frames.

## Features

- **Target Analysis**: Quickly assess the difficulty of any target based on level difference
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Uses the classic difficulty color system for instant recognition

2. Extract to your `World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\Consider\` folder
3. Restart World of Warcraft or reload your UI (`/reload`)
4. The addon will confirm it's loaded with a chat message

## Usage

### Setting Up Your Keybind
1. Type `/consider` in chat to open the settings window
2. Either:
   - Click **Capture Key** and press your desired key combination
   - Type a key combination (e.g., `SHIFT-G`, `CTRL-F`) in the text field and press Enter

### Using Consider
- Press your keybind while targeting a mob/player to see the difficulty assessment
- Alternatively, use `/con` for testing without a keybind

## Difficulty Colors

The addon uses the classic MMO color system to indicate difficulty:

| Color | Meaning      | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| ðŸŸ¥ Red    | Impossible | Target will likely defeat you easily |
| ðŸŸ§ Orange | Very Hard  | Would take exceptional skill to defeat |
| ðŸŸ¨ Yellow | Harder     | A challenging but winnable fight |
| â¬œ White  | Even Match | Fair fight with uncertain outcome |
| ðŸŸ¦ Blue   | Easier     | You have a clear advantage |
| ðŸŸ© Green  | Much Easier| Target poses little threat |
| â¬› Gray   | No Reward  | Too weak to provide experience/rewards |



## Commands
